This is Nikos, playing.

Apple pie:
- 2kg of apples
- 3 eggs
- 1.5 kg of flour
- Butter
- 1 spoon of Cinnamon
- Lots of love

Nikos managed to screw things up, and now he is crying on the floor.
A disaster, really. Beyond repair, down in despair.

So Nikos maybe I can help? If you ever want to talk about it I'm here.
